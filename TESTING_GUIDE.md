# SaludPlus - Final Testing Guide

## 🎯 SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

### Servers Running

-   **Backend**: http://localhost:5000 ✅
-   **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 ✅
-   **Database**: Connected with updated UUID schema ✅

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### 1. Registration & Authentication

**Test Steps:**

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Go to Register page
3. Create a new patient account with:
    - Name: Test Patient
    - Email: patient@test.com
    - Password: password123
    - Role: Patient
    - Phone: 555-0123
    - Date of Birth: 1990-01-01

**Expected Results:**

-   ✅ Password should be hashed with bcrypt
-   ✅ User should be created with UUID
-   ✅ Should redirect to login

### 2. Login Verification

**Test Steps:**

1. Login with the created credentials
2. Verify dashboard loads correctly

**Expected Results:**

-   ✅ Password verification with bcrypt
-   ✅ User session established
-   ✅ Role-based redirect to patient dashboard

### 3. Appointment System

**Test Steps:**

1. As patient, book a new appointment
2. Add symptoms: "severe headache and fever"
3. Select appointment type
4. Submit appointment

**Expected Results:**

-   ✅ Symptoms field should be saved
-   ✅ Priority should be calculated as "ALTA" (due to "fever")
-   ✅ Status should be "PROGRAMADA"
-   ✅ UUID should be generated for appointment

### 4. Doctor Registration

**Test Steps:**

1. Register a doctor account
2. Select a specialty from dropdown
3. Complete registration

**Expected Results:**

-   ✅ Doctor role should create both Usuario and Medico records
-   ✅ Specialty relationship should be established
-   ✅ UUIDs should be used for all relationships

### 5. Doctor Dashboard

**Test Steps:**

1. Login as doctor
2. View appointments tab
3. Check appointment details and status options

**Expected Results:**

-   ✅ Appointments should display with Spanish statuses
-   ✅ Status updates should work (PROGRAMADA → CONFIRMADA → COMPLETADA)
-   ✅ Priority indicators should show correctly
-   ✅ Symptoms should be visible in appointment details

### 6. Medical Records

**Test Steps:**

1. As doctor, create a medical record for a patient
2. Fill in diagnosis, symptoms, treatment
3. Add medications and allergies
4. Save record

**Expected Results:**

-   ✅ Structured data should be saved (not JSON blob)
-   ✅ Medications and allergies as JSON arrays
-   ✅ Vital signs as JSON object
-   ✅ UUID relationships maintained

### 7. Admin Panel

**Test Steps:**

1. Access admin dashboard
2. View user management
3. Check system statistics

**Expected Results:**

-   ✅ Real database data (no mock data)
-   ✅ CRUD operations for users
-   ✅ Live statistics from database
-   ✅ Audit trail functionality

## 🔧 TECHNICAL VALIDATIONS

### Database Schema Verification

```sql
-- Check that UUIDs are being used
SELECT id, nombre, email, rol FROM Usuario LIMIT 5;

-- Verify password hashing
SELECT email, LENGTH(contraseña) as password_length FROM Usuario;

-- Check appointment priorities
SELECT fecha, sintomas, prioridad FROM Cita WHERE sintomas IS NOT NULL;
```

### API Endpoint Tests

-   ✅ `/api/auth/register` - bcrypt hashing
-   ✅ `/api/auth/login` - password verification
-   ✅ `/api/appointments` - UUID CRUD operations
-   ✅ `/api/patients/:id/medical-records` - structured data
-   ✅ `/api/admin/users` - real database operations

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Registration Fails

1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify database connection
3. Ensure all required fields are provided
4. Check for email uniqueness conflicts

### If Appointment Priority Calculation Fails

1. Verify symptoms are being saved
2. Check priority calculation logic in backend
3. Test with keywords: "dolor severo", "fiebre", "sangrado"

### If Frontend Errors Occur

1. Check browser console for TypeScript errors
2. Verify all services are using correct Spanish enum values
3. Ensure UUID formats are consistent
